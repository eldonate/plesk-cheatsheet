===Search for content in every domain's log file===

Lets say you are looking for a contact form that is getting a lot of spam.
Navigate to /var/www/vhosts/subscription/logs/
and run the following

find . -type f -name 'access_ssl_log' | xargs -I {} sh -c "echo 'File: {}'; grep 'POST' {} | grep -c 'contact'"

This will grep POST and contact that will usually give you some hints.
